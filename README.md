## What is pg_stat_monitor?
The **pg_stat_monitor** is a **PostgreSQL Query Performance Monitoring** tool, based on PostgreSQL's contrib module ``pg_stat_statements``. PostgreSQLâ€™s pg_stat_statements provides the basic statistics, which is sometimes not enough. The major shortcoming in pg_stat_statements is that it accumulates all the queries and their statistics and does not provide aggregated statistics nor histogram information. In this case, a user needs to calculate the aggregate which is quite expensive. 

**pg_stat_monitor** is developed on the basis of pg_stat_statements as its more advanced replacement. It provides all the features of pg_stat_statements plus its own feature set.  

### How pg_stat_monitor works?

pg_stat_monitor accumulates the information in the form of buckets. All the aggregated information is bucket based. The size of a bucket and the number of buckets should be configured using GUC (Grand Unified Configuration). When a bucket time elapses, pg_stat_monitor resets all the statistics and switches to the next bucket. After the last bucket elapses, pg_stat_monitor goes back to the first bucket. All the data on the first bucket will vanish; therefore, users must read the buckets before that to not lose the data.

## Supported PostgreSQL Versions
The ``pg_stat_monitor`` should work on the latest version of PostgreSQL but is only tested with these PostgreSQL versions:

| Distribution            |  Version       | Supported          |
| ------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| PostgreSQL              | Version < 11   | :x:                |
| PostgreSQL              | Version 11     | :heavy_check_mark: |
| PostgreSQL              | Version 12     | :heavy_check_mark: |
| PostgreSQL              | Version 13     | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Percona Distribution    | Version < 11   | :x:                |
| Percona Distribution    | Version 11     | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Percona Distribution    | Version 12     | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Percona Distribution    | Version 13     | :heavy_check_mark: |

## Installation
``pg_stat_monitor`` is supplied as part of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL. The rpm/deb packages are available from Percona repositories. Refer to [Percona Documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/postgresql/LATEST/installing.html) for installation instructions. 

### Installing from source code

You can download the source code of the latest release of ``pg_stat_monitor``  from [this GitHub page](https://github.com/Percona/pg_stat_monitor/releases) or using git:
```sh
git clone git://github.com/Percona/pg_stat_monitor.git
```

Compile and install the extension
```sh
cd pg_stat_monitor
make USE_PGXS=1
make USE_PGXS=1 install
```

## Setup
``pg_stat_monitor`` cannot be enabled in your running PostgreSQL instance. ``pg_stat_monitor`` needs to be loaded at the start time. This requires adding the  ``pg_stat_monitor`` extension for the ``shared_preload_libraries`` parameter and restarting the PostgreSQL instance.

You can set the  ``pg_stat_monitor`` extension in the ``postgresql.conf`` file.

```
# - Shared Library Preloading -

shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_monitor' # (change requires restart)
#local_preload_libraries = ''
#session_preload_libraries = ''
```

Or you can set it from `psql` terminal using the ``alter system`` command.

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_monitor';
ALTER SYSTEM
```

```sh
sudo systemctl restart postgresql-13
```


Create the extension using the ``CREATE EXTENSION`` command.
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_monitor;
CREATE EXTENSION
```

```sql
-- Select some of the query information, like client_ip, username and application_name etc.

SELECT application_name, userid::regrole AS user_name, datname AS database_name, substr(query,0, 50) AS query, calls, client_ip 
           FROM pg_stat_monitor, pg_database 
           WHERE dbid = oid;
 
 application_name  | user_name | database_name |                       query                       | calls | client_ip
